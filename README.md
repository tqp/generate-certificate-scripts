# generate_certificate_scripts

These are scripts that can be used to create Certificate Authority or cert/jks/pem files.  

## The Basic Scripts
The basic-scripts are based on instructions from this website:   
https://deliciousbrains.com/ssl-certificate-authority-for-local-https-development/

## The Automated Scripts
The "automated-scripts" are based on scripts developed by "TB".  
They may need significant modification to be used for your purposes.  
I imcluded them because they are a GREAT example/template for bash scripting.
